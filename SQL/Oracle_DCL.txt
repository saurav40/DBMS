      Create a trigger on a table.
      Update data in a table or in a subset of columns in a table.
      Run a specified function or procedure.
      Use a sequence generator or a user-defined type.

--Syntax for tables--
   GRANT privilege-type ON [TABLE] { table-Name | view-Name } TO grantees
   eg.- Grant select on table users to saurabh;
        Grant create on table products to saurabh;
        Grant update,trigger on table incidents to saurabh,Satish;

--Syntax for routines--
    GRANT EXECUTE ON { FUNCTION | PROCEDURE } routine-designator TO grantees
    eg:- Grant execute on Procedure p to maria;

--Syntax for roles--
   GRANT roleName [ {, roleName }* ] TO grantees
   eg:- GRANT admin_role, manager_role TO user1, user2;

--Syntax for sequence generators--
  GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCE [ schemaName. ] SQL92Identifier TO grantees
  eg:- grant usage on sequence seq1 to saurabh;

--Syntax for user-defined types
  GRANT USAGE ON TYPE [ schemaName. ] SQL92Identifier TO grantees
  eg:- GRANT USAGE ON TYPE price TO finance_role;


---*************REVOKE*************---
Use the REVOKE statement to remove privileges from a specific user or role, or from all users, to perform actions on database objects.
You can also use the REVOKE statement to revoke a role from a user, from PUBLIC, or from another role.

 The following types of privileges can be revoked:
        Delete data from a specific table.
        Insert data into a specific table.
        Create a foreign key reference to the named table or to a subset of columns from a table.

        Create a trigger on a table.
        Update data in a table or in a subset of columns in a table.
        Run a specified routine (function or procedure).
        Use a sequence generator or a user-defined type.
     
--Syntax for tables--
    REVOKE privilege-type ON [ TABLE ] { table-Name | view-Name } FROM grantees
    eg:- Revoke select on table users from saurabh;
         Revoke create on table products from saurabh;
         Revoke update,trigger on table incidents from saurabh,Satish;

--Syntax for routines
    REVOKE EXECUTE ON { FUNCTION | PROCEDURE } routine-designator FROM grantees  RESTRICT
    eg:- revoke execute on Procedure p from maria restrict;

--Syntax for roles
    REVOKE roleName [ {, roleName }* ] FROM grantees;
    eg:- revoke dmin_role, manager_role from user1, user2;

--Syntax for sequence generators
   REVOKE USAGE ON SEQUENCE [ schemaName. ] SQL92Identifier FROM grantees RESTRICT
   eg:- revoke usage on sequence myseq1 from saurabh restrict;

--Syntax for user-defined types
   REVOKE USAGE ON TYPE  [ schemaName. ] SQL92Identifier FROM grantees RESTRICT
   eg:- revoke usage on type hr.price to user_role;
